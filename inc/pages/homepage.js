# Math Made Easy: GCF and LCM Calculator

**Find the greatest common factor and least common multiple of two numbers.**

## Simplify Your Math Problems with GCF LCM

Welcome to our online GCF LCM calculator â€” the ultimate tool for tackling mathematical challenges effortlessly. Whether you're dealing with the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) or the Least Common Multiple (LCM), our user-friendly interface is designed for simplicity and speed.

The greatest common factor (GCF) and least common multiple (LCM) are two important concepts in basic math. They are used to simplify fractions, find the prime factorization of numbers, and solve word problems. This calculator will find the GCF and LCM of two numbers.

The **GCF is the largest number that divides evenly into two or more numbers**. The **LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of two or more numbers**.

For example, the GCF of 12 and 18 is 6 because 6 is the largest number that divides evenly into both 12 and 18. The LCM of 12 and 18 is 36 because 36 is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 12 and 18.

The GCF and LCM are used to simplify fractions. For example, the GCF of 12 and 18 is 6, so the fraction 12/18 can be simplified to 2/3. The LCM of 12 and 18 is 36, so the fraction 12/18 can be simplified to 1/3.

The GCF and LCM are also used to find the prime factorization of numbers. For example, the prime factorization of 12 is 2 x 2 x 3, and the prime factorization of 18 is 2 x 3 x 3. The GCF of 12 and 18 is 6, so the prime factorization of 6 is 2 x 3. The LCM of 12 and 18 is 36, so the prime factorization of 36 is 2 x 2 x 3 x 3.

The GCF and LCM are also used to solve word problems. For example, if you have 12 apples and 18 oranges, you can find the GCF of 12 and 18 to find out how many apples and oranges you have in total. The GCF of 12 and 18 is 6, so you have 6 apples and 6 oranges.

The GCF and LCM are also used to find the prime factorization of numbers. For example, the prime factorization of 12 is 2 x 2 x 3, and the prime factorization of 18 is 2 x 3 x 3. The GCF of 12 and 18 is 6, so the prime factorization of 6 is 2 x 3. The LCM of 12 and 18 is 36, so the prime factorization of 36 is 2 x 2 x 3 x 3.

## What is GCF?

The greatest common factor (GCF) is the largest number that divides evenly into two or more numbers. For example, the GCF of 12 and 18 is 6 because 6 is the largest number that divides evenly into both 12 and 18.

Uncover the secrets of the Greatest Common Factor (GCF), also known as the greatest common denominator or highest common divisor. This tool is your go-to solution for finding the shared factors among 2 or more numbers.

## What is LCM?

The least common multiple (LCM) is the smallest number that is a multiple of two or more numbers. For example, the LCM of 12 and 18 is 36 because 36 is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 12 and 18.

Navigate the world of multiples with ease. The Least Common Multiple (LCM) calculator helps you identify the smallest common multiple for 2 or more numbers, streamlining your mathematical journey.
